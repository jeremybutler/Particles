Project is a shell that will allow rapid development of canvas based application in javascript.
The project will allow dynamic resizing of the canvas and will allow for better handling of application states,
views, errors etc.

On the roadmap:
I would like to include html nodes to the project to allow people to fully build their web applications client
using this framework.
